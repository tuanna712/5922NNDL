Solution:
Below are my recommended environment settings, which I have tested for Coding Tutorials 7 to 11:

Python 3.10.16
Requirements.txt (attachment)

Other notes:
If you close the Shell Window tab, the Jupyter Lab will be immediately terminated.
If you create a new Conda environment and don't see it in Jupyter Lab. Follow these steps to add the environment to Jupyter Lab's environment list:
Install the ipykernel package.

Run this command on terminal:

python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<env_name> --display-name "<Name to display in Jupyter Lab>"

Coding Tutorial 8, use the following command on terminal to download the SpaCy “en_core_web_sm” model, if it can't be loaded from notebook:

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

In Tutorial 7, if you encounter an error with torchinfo while printing the model summary, add the device argument as shown below:

summary(model, input_size=(1, 40, 58), device="cpu")

# Start Jupyter
jupyter lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser --allow-root
